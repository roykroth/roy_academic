# Roy's Academic Webpage

This is my academic webpage. I used to host it as my personal github page at roykroth.github.io, but since I am going to use a custom domain I thought it was just simpler to host it out of the docs folder on the main repo itself. Then I don't have to deal with multiple repositories for what should be a very simple site. Once it is up and working I will just use my personal domain.
