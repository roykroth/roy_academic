I explore the optimal timing of financing for venture capital-backed companies. In doing so, I make a distinction between staged investment and staged financing, and focus on the latter. Raising a larger percentage of the total needed funds upfront presents operational efficiencies, lowering the cost of the project, but increases the scale of agency problems and sacrifices the option value of delay. The optimal financing path depends upon the relative magnitudes of efficiency gains from upfront financing and the value of waiting. Furthermore, I consider the effects of entrepreneurial optimism and find that the effect on staging depends on the precision of intermediate information.
